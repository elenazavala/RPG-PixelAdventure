# eecs448_project2

To run this project, a webserver is needed to run the Phaser 3 framework for security reasons.
The game can be loaded through the index.html in the root directory of the project.
The project is also hosted on https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~m905s765/eecs448/eecs448_project3/index.html .
After a game over, the webpage must be refreshed to try again.
